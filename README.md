# Temporizador

A C# project that do a countdown of your choice.

The program starts "asking" u to insert the time u want to start as hours, minutes and seconds, offering 2 input options: textbox and combobox.

There's 4 ringtones options, from the games Deltarune (options 0-2) and Undertale (option 3). 

U can add ringtones by putting the audio file in "Temporizador\bin\Debug" and typing the name of it in the "ringtones.txt" file, located in the same place (don't forget to put ".mp3" after the name of the file in the "ringtones.txt").

The code has some comments at the end that u can ignore if u want to, mainly because it's on brazilian portuguese. But basicaly they r notes of what I did and to-dos.

That's it, thanks for reading!
