# Temporizador

A C# project that do a countdown of your choice.

The program starts "asking" u to insert the time u want to start as hours, minutes and seconds, offering 2 input options: textbox and combobox. The textBox is marked as preferencial, but if it's equal zero, the program consider whats on the combobox. There's 4 ringtones options, from the games Deltarune (options 0-2) and Undertale (option 3).

The code has some comments at the end that u can ignore if u want to, mainly because it's on brazilian portuguese. But basicaly they r notes of what I did and to-dos.

That's it, thanks for reading!
